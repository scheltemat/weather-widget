### Overview
- This is a simple weather app to display weather data based on a search location. It populates HTML elements using DOM manipulation and pulls data from a weather API. And my grandma says it looks pretty :)

### How to Use
- Type in a city name and hit the enter button. The app only works by city or state name, though I'm not sure why you would try to look up weather for an entire state.
